    <h1>Avatar Factory Preview Library</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Avatar Factory's Augmented Reality Preview Library.
    <p>I created this in order to view Avatars from the web on an iPhone 7 or iPad gen.5 or higher device running iOS 12.</p>
    <p>No App Required!</p>
    <p>Tap an image in the menu below and it will launch "Quick Look".</p>
    <p>This is what Object Look Looks like;</p>
    <p><img src="object.png"></p>
    <p>If you select AR, then it will launch your camera and the model will appear in your scene.  Follow the screen prompts to create a floor plane which will anchor the model.</p>
    <p><img src="ar.png"></p>
    <p> You can use finger gestures to manipulate the model.</p>

    <h1>Menu;</h1>
    <p>There are many Avatars - these are just a few that show Dynamic, Still Life subjects and Graphics.</p>
    <p>Even though you can forward on these models to other people, I prefer you did not for now.</p>
    <p>These models are small for table top use but, can be lifesize.</p>
